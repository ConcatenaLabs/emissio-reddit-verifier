# Working on emissio-reddit-verifier

Notes for AI coding agents and new contributors: what is not obvious from the
code, and where getting it wrong is expensive.

## What this repository is

The Reddit app (Devvit) that lets a Reddit user prove to Sequentia Emissio
that they own their account. It runs on Reddit, installed on r/sequentia; it
is not a web service and cannot be called from outside Reddit. Reddit will not
allow-list our own domain for outbound requests, and Reddit refuses
unauthenticated reads from our server, so the proof travels with the user as
a signed token. The verifier for that token lives in the `emissio` repository
(`verifications.go`); the two must agree on the format in `src/token.ts`, and
the Emissio test suite carries a vector produced by this signer. A change to
the format is a change to both repositories in the same sitting.

## Deploying

Uploading needs a Reddit account that moderates r/sequentia, logged in once
with `npx devvit login` on the machine doing the upload. Then `npm run upload`,
`npx devvit install r/sequentia`, and `npx devvit settings set tokenSecret`
with the same secret the Emissio server has in `EMISSIO_REDDIT_TOKEN_SECRET`.
The secret is never committed; it lives in the Emissio credentials file on the
operator's laptop and in a systemd drop-in on the server.

Apps can be installed on subreddits under 200 members without Reddit's review.
Above that, or for listing in the app directory, `npx devvit publish` submits
the app for review.

## Working with git and GitHub here

These rules are the same in every Sequentia repository. They are repeated in each
one because this file is the only thing an agent is guaranteed to read, whatever
machine it is working from.

**Nothing pushed to GitHub credits Claude, Anthropic, or any AI tool.** No
`Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, no `Claude-Session:` trailer or `claude.ai`
link, no "Generated with Claude Code" in a commit message or a pull request body,
no `claude/*` branch names or session ids, and no mention in source, comments,
docs or issue text. Agent tooling offers several of these by default; compose the
message without them rather than stripping them afterwards.

**Author every commit as the person the session is working for.** Several people
commit in these repositories and an agent always runs on behalf of one of them,
so derive the author from the authenticated GitHub account rather than from a
list of names that goes stale the moment somebody new arrives:

    git -c user.name="$(gh api user --jq '.name // .login')" \
        -c user.email="$(gh api user --jq '"\(.id)+\(.login)@users.noreply.github.com"')" \
        commit ...

That address is the GitHub `noreply` form, which is what links a commit to its
account and keeps private addresses out of a public history. When `gh` is not
authenticated as the person the work belongs to, ask them instead of guessing.

**Never infer the author from `git log`.** The clones carry no `user.name` or
`user.email`, so `git commit` stops with "Author identity unknown" and the
nearest answer to hand is the author of the last commit — which is whoever
pushed last and says nothing about who is working now. Attributing a commit to
someone who did not write it puts their name on code they never reviewed, and
taking it back costs a history rewrite and a force-push over commits other
machines have already pulled.

**Every change lands through a pull request that you merge yourself, at once.**
There is no reviewer on this project; the pull request exists so the reasoning is
recorded beside the diff. Branch, push, open it, merge it, delete the branch, all
in one sitting. Pushing straight to the default branch is the rule most often
broken here, and it is the one that costs the record. A pull request stays open
only when the repository owner asks for that specific one, and that never carries
over to the next.

**Name branches `area/short-description`**: `fix/`, `doc/`, `feature/`, `test/`,
`build/`, or the component being changed. Never a tool name, a session id, or
`worktree-*`.

**Write the subject as `area: what changed`**, one line, 72 characters at the
outside and 50 where you can manage it. Put the reasoning in the body, and
explain why rather than what.

**These repositories are public and world-readable.** Never commit private keys,
seeds, `wallet.dat`, RPC credentials, `.env` files or API tokens. Read the diff
before every commit. Secrets belong on the server and in offline backups.

**A file belongs to the repository whose code it describes.** Decide which repo
owns it before writing it; if it landed in the wrong one, move it rather than
deleting it.

**Documentation is part of the change, not a follow-up.** A change that makes a
README, a doc page, a runbook or a code comment wrong is not finished until that
text is right again, in the same pull request as the code. Before you open the
pull request, search the repository for whatever you renamed, moved or removed —
the old binary name, the old path, the old flag, the old command — and fix every
hit. If the change falsifies another repository's documentation, that repository
gets its own pull request in the same sitting. A stale instruction costs a new
user more than a missing one: they trust it, run it, it fails, and the failure
reads as broken software rather than as an out-of-date sentence.

**Write documentation to be timeless.** Assume the reader is new, arrived today,
and wants to know what the software is and how to use it right now. They do not
care what changed, what it used to be called, or which version added what. So
write in the present tense about current behaviour, and leave the history out:
no changelogs, no "new in", no "recently", no "coming soon", no status or
progress sections, no roadmaps, no dated notes. Quote a version number only where
the reader cannot act without it, and prefer pointing at the file that carries it
over copying the digits. Timeless does not mean thin — what the product is, who
it is for, and how to install, configure and use it all still belong there, in
full. Documentation written this way survives a release without an edit, which is
what keeps it true; the history already has homes in the git log, the tags and
the release notes.

**Push the same day you commit.** The testnet server pulls only from GitHub, so a
branch left on one laptop is invisible to every other machine and to the box.
